# Put JavaScript libraries you use in this folder

Our project uses the following libraries:

1. Plotly
Plotly is a front-end library for data science models. This free library provides online graphing, statistical analysis tools, and supports a variety of languages, including Python and R. 
We chose to use Plotly instead of more popular visualizations such as Matplotlib because Plotly has an easier map to use. 

We already include D3 for you. For each library create a folder including a `LICENSE` text file with the software license for the library.
