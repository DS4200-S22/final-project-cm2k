# Put JavaScript libraries you use in this folder

Our project uses the following libraries:

1. Plotly (not yet implemented):
Plotly is a front-end library for data science models. This free library provides online graphing, statistical analysis tools, and supports a variety of languages, including Python and R. 
We chose to use Plotly instead of more popular visualizations such as Matplotlib because Plotly has an easier map to use. 


We already include D3 for you. For each library create a folder including a `LICENSE` text file with the software license for the library.

Our project uses the following sources:
1. Line Chart Guide for D3: https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_basic.html 
We used this line chart guide as a stepping stone for our own line chart. The website gives a very basic understanding of how to create line charts in d3, which we used to set up our line chart. Set up includes the helper function d3.line(), interactivity (not yet implemented), and how to switch between data sources. This website will be useful in the upcoming weeks as well, when we implement switching data (from COVID Cases to Deaths) and interactivity (time-toggling).
