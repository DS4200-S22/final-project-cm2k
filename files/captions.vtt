Hi! This is our COVID-19 Dashboard, created as part of our Final Project for Professor Mosca’s DS4200 class in Spring 2022.

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:13.147
Our aim for this project was to allow the user to visualize the amount of COVID cases and deaths over time,

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:15.499
as well as view this data on a geographic model.

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.002
We used a bar and line graph to visualize cases,

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:23.691
and from the drop down menu you can select a state to see the total amount of COVID cases over time.

00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:30.481
As you can see here, our x-axis is the date, and our y-axis represents the amount of cases for that date.

00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:35.936
Users can choose between all 50 states, as well as outlying territories.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:43.711
One of our goals was to implement brushing and linking so that users could zoom in on certain sections of the graphs

00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.814
to get a closer look at the COVID case data for that state in the given time period.

00:00:46.997 --> 00:00:50.651
We also wanted to include a chloropleth map visualization to be able to hover over the states

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.470
and see the amount of cases on a certain day.

00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:57.408
To do this, we wanted to include a slider for the user to pick a different date over 2 years of the pandemic.

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:06.117
While we weren’t able to implement all the features we wanted, in the future we would want to add more interactivity to our project -

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:09.937
for example, more data for the user to switch between, such as number of vaccinations,

00:01:09.938 --> 00:01:12.089
as well as a prettier webpage. Thank you!
