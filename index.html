    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>
      Since its first discovery in late 2019, COVID-19 has swept through much of the world. It changed the way we
      interacted with each other. Thus, for our project, we want to analyze the impact it had on the human population
      through cases, deaths, and vaccinations. We want to analyze specific locations and timeframes that are of interest
      to our potential users. Our users will be able to quickly see the USAâ€™s trends with COVID cases and handling,
      along with a state-by-state analysis of such information. This enables users to have a more specific, reliable,
      and detailed version of COVID data that they can easily comprehend and trust.

    <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>

    <p>
      The intention of the COVID-19 Dashboard is to provide users with a way to easily see information about COVID-19
      statistics,
      particularly in the area of cases and deaths over time. Users can see which locations in the United States have
      the highest COVID rates, summarize the amount of cases in the 2 years since the pandemic started, and see any
      trends in case of COVID-19
      that may or may not have to do with the geographical location of an uptick in cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      This visualization relies on a bar graph, line graph, and chloropleth to visually convey the data that is being
      shown to
      the user. In terms of interactivity, the user is allowed to select what state/territory to examine COVID cases in,
      as well as
      zoom in on the graph via brushing and linking to examine a certain date range of COVID cases more closely. Users
      may hover over each bar
      or point in the line to see a number representing the total amount of COVID cases in the selected state up until
      that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below these two graphs, we intended for there to be a chloropleth, with darker colored states representing more
      COVID cases overall.
      The date would be changed by a slider, and would update the map of the U.S. over time with the amount of COVID
      cases per state.
      If the user hovers over the state, it would show fast facts about the state (ex. name, date of first COVID
      infection) and display
      the total amount of COVID cases in that state.
